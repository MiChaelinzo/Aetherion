# Aetherion
Aetherion is an interstellar intelligence platform designed to explore, track, and visualize objects that drift beyond the familiar boundaries of our solar system. Inspired by the ancient concept of the aether—the cosmic medium once thought to carry light—Aetherion transforms raw astrophysical data into living, interactive narratives of the universe
