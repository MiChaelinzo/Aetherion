# Interstellar Watch

## 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge Submission

A comprehensive web platform for tracking, analyzing, and simulating interstellar objects and near-Earth asteroids, developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.

## Overview

Interstellar Watch is an interactive visualization and simulation tool that enables users to explore asteroid impact scenarios, predict consequences, and evaluate mitigation strategies using real data.
